# Sambot for Vindinium Artificial Intelligence Competition  
This is for CS460 - Artificial Intelligence class Final Exam - Vindinium A.I. challenge

## Overview

This is a simple Java client for the [Vindinium](http://vindinium.org) game.  Vindinium is a simple game played by an AI via HTTP.  
In order to compete in Vindinium, I implemented my own bot named 'SamBot' that uses Conditional A* Search to fight/retreat depending on probability to win the battle.

The source code for SamBot can be found at src/main/java/com/brianstempin/vindiniumclient/bot/advanced/sambot/SamBot.java
